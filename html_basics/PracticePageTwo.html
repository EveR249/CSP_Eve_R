        <h1>Class Review</h1>
        <p>This class has been overall pretty good I would say. We did a lot of things that have helped me learn. I enjoyed programming a lot more that I thought I would. I likes learning about hardware vs software and how they interacted. My favorite things we did were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Taking apart and putting back together a computer</li>
            <li>Programming in C</li>
            <li>Making a game in Python</li>
        </ol>
