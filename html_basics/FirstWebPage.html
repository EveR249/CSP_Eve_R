        <h3>Types of Painting</h3>
             <p>There are many different types of painting, acrylic, oil, and watercolor. Painting can help you relax your mind and process emotions. My favorite type of painting is watercolor. You have so much more freedom as compared to other mediums.<br> It can be hard to paint when you're first starting out and things don't turn out the way you want them to. Don't be discouraged, it just takes practice. The more you paint the better you will get at it. </p>
        <h3>Art Block</h3>
            <p>Art block is a common problem that artists encounter and it can be hard to overcome. What I do to help with art block is look through my camera roll and try to draw one of my favorite photos. Usually while doing this I can observe something specifically found in the photo that I want to include in my art. This helps my creative flow and gives me ideas.</p>
