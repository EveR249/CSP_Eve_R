        <h1>Sunsets VS Sunrises</h1>
        <p>There has always been debate about whether sunrises or sunsets are better. I think sunsets are better because you don't have to wake up early to see them. Sunrises are better if you're an early bird who likes solitude, but that is not the case for me. Here are reasons why I love sunsets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They are <span id="title" onmouseover="show()" onmouseleave="hide()">VERY</span> pretty</li>
            <li>it's warmer than in the morning</li>
            <li>You can watch it with friends or family because everyone is awake</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From these reasons you can clearly see why sunsets are better. Sunrises have their moments, but they are nothing compared to that of a sunset. I love sunsets and I don't have anything against people who dont't, but they are clearly better than sunrises.</p>
